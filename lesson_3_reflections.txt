When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Whenever I'm doing a collaborative project or whenever I want other people to check my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because if somebody else is also working on the project I would like to check their changes to the remote before
	deciding if I want to pull those changes to my local respository. 
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork: Clone of a repository that lives in GitHub to another location directly in github servers.
	Branch: Copy of the state of the current commit that separates from the main version of the project
	so it can be experimented with without affecting the master branch.
	Clone: A copy of a remote repository to a local directory.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	That way I can have access to the most recent update to the remote in case i need it.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	When collaborating in a project its not advisable to update the master branch directly because not everyone would be able
	to clarily see which changes have been made. Instead its better to create a branch locally with the change and push it to 
	the remote and then create a pull request, that way everyone participating can check every change to the project before is
	officially made.
