When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Whenever I'm doing a collaborative project or whenever I want other people to check my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because if somebody else is also working on the project I would like to check their changes to the remote before
	deciding if I want to pull those changes to my local respository. 
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork: Clone of a repository that lives in GitHub to another location directly in github servers.
	Branch: Copy of the state of the current commit that separates from the main version of the project
	so it can be experimented with without affecting the master branch.
	Clone: A copy of a remote repository to a local directory.
