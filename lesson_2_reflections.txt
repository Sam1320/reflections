What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	a '.git' directory is created that contains metadata about the files inside the directory in which the repository is initialized.
	This directory keeps track of all the modifications (i.e commits) made to the files in the repository. 
	It's necessary to initialize a repository because this '.git' directory is the one that allows git to control the commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It offers a 'middel point' to organize the changes made. It allows you to bundle different files in a single commit in case
	its necessary. Its different from the repository and the working directory because its actually a conection between the two
	the files go from the WD to the SA to the repository in that order. It provides a tool for better organization of commits.
